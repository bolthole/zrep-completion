# 0.2.0

- ZREP help message changed, so need to update `__zrep_list_commands()` which extracts command names from it. Perhaps this approach is too fragile?
- Tested to work with ZREP 1.8

# 0.1.0

- Refactoring of code to iron out some edge cases
- Use ZREP to list commands, datasets and snapshots for completion
- Tested to work with ZREP 1.7.7
